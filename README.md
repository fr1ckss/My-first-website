# The first site in my portfolio

Hi, I'm 14 years old, I'm studying web development and this is my first website. True, only with 2 pages, but I will develop it and improve my skills. I posted it on GitHub to get acquainted with this platform. Maybe someone wants to look at my site or give advice on how to do it differently, then I will be very glad :)

P.S. I laid out the main page according to the guide from YouTube and the About Us page I already wrote myself. I also did the loading of the site and the scrollbar myself and partly the Internet)
